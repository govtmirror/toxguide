										"\n\u2022 Aluminum is ubiquitous in the environment. For the general population, exposure to aluminum most likely occurs through the consumption of food, water, and aluminum containing medicinals, such as antacids, buffered analgesics, antidiarrheal agents, or antiulcerative medication."
										"\n\u2022 Inhalation exposure and dermal contact may also contribute a small amount to an individual’s daily aluminum exposure."

									"\n\u2022 Aluminum is poorly absorbed following either oral or inhalation exposure and is essentially not absorbed dermally. Approximately 1.5-2 of inhaled and 0.01- 5% of ingested aluminum is absorbed. The absorption efficiency is dependent on chemical form, particle size (inhalation), and concurrent dietary exposure to chelators such as citric acid or lactic acid (oral)."
									"\n\u2022 Aluminum binds to various ligands in the blood and distributes to every organ, with highest concentrations ultimately found in bone and lung tissues."
									"\n\u2022 Absorbed aluminum is excreted principally in the urine and, to a lesser extent, in the bile."
									"\n\nNormal Human Levels"
									"\n\u2022 The total body burden of aluminum in healthy individuals is 30 to 50 mg."
									"\n\u2022 Approximately 50% of the body burden is in the skeleton and 25% is in the lungs."
									"\n\u2022 Aluminum levels in lungs increase with age."

	"\n\u2022 Aluminum metal is used to make beverage cans, pots and pans, automotive components, siding and roofing, and foil."
	"\n\u2022 Aluminum compounds are used in water treatment, abrasives, and furnace linings. Powdered aluminum metal is used in explosives and fireworks."

	"\n\nAluminum in the Environment"
	"\n\u2022 Aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth’s crust."
	"\n\u2022 High levels in the environment can be part of the natural deposits in the earth or caused by the mining and processing of its ores and by production of aluminum metal, alloys, and compounds."
	"\n\u2022 Aluminum cannot be destroyed in the environment. It can only change its form or become attached to or separated from particles."
	"\n\u2022 Aluminum is only sparingly soluble in water between pH 6 and 8; thus aluminum concentration in most natural waters is extremely low."

Impaired performance on neurobehavioral tests of motor function, sensory function, and cognitive function have been observed in animals. Neurobehavioral alterations have been observed following exposure of adult or weanling animals and in animals exposed during gestation and/or lactation."
